&emsp; Buskers in Mong Kok have to contend with other act and throngs of pedestrians. 
&emsp; Sai Yeung Choi Street South in Mong Kok was once a **vibrant** performing ground for Hong Kong's unknown artists and street performers. The iconic strip stretches from Prince Edward to Yau Mei Tei, boasting a variety of acts from acrobatics to magic and music. 
&emsp; But these days, a **turf war** between buskers has broken out. This has raised concerns about noise pollution and crowd control. 
&emsp; Busker Alva Leung Lok-hei, 27, a member of music group 3jammers, says: "Finding a spot here is almost impossible and when you do succeed, there's often a continuous fight with others to draw crowds by trying to be the loudest. 
&emsp; Busking in Hong Kong us legal, with or without a permit, as long as the noise isn't a **nuisance** or the act doesn't cause an **obstruction**. 
&emsp; In an ideal world, Mong Kok regular Alanstair Lau would like to navigate through "an obstacle course" every day. "I used to enjoy strolling through Sai Yeung Choi Street South because it was full og lively and eye-catching performances, ut now I would rather take a **detour** because it has become too crowded and noisy," he says. 
&emsp; Because of the squeeze, Lau often finds himself edging though throngs of pedestrians glued to their mobile phones or having to dodge deliverymen barrelling through the crowd with trolleys. 
&emsp; He wants to see the streets transformed into a well-planned outdoor theatre with a variety of performances to take in. 
&emsp; In late 2015, the first-ever census on Hong Kong street performers was conducted by Chinese University's department of psychology. The report found there were an estimated 300 street entertainers across the city. 
&emsp; According to the census, more than 95 per cent of these artists were local residents. Among all the performers surveyed, 90 per cent of them specialized in music per cent in dance, 2 per cent in **acrobatics** and 1 per cent in theatre. 
&emsp; "There were times when I would see other people look down on the performers, which would make me feel upset. I think we should really appreciate their courage and effort, no matter what form of art it is," Lau says, adding he believes there is a lack of openness towards street artists. 
&emsp; Busker Alva Leung says: "I see that street performers aren't really appreciated, especially in Hong Kong. I do believe it's because locals aren't open-minded enough. 
&emsp; He recalls an unpleasant experience in which he was asked by security to **vacate** an area in the middle of a performance. He complied out of courtesy. "Even if only one person complains about our volume being too high or ust the fact that we are causing a bit of a disturbance in any way, we are asked to leave. It just shows you how one-sided and unfair the situation can be. 
&emsp; The singer hopes the public can understand and appreciate that most buskers take to the streets because of their love of music and art. 
&emsp; "The public needs to know that learning to play music comes with a price and just because we have decided to perform on the street doesn't make us beggars," Leung says.

&emsp; 旺角的街头艺人不得不与其他表演和人群竞争。
&emsp; 旺角的西洋菜街南曾经是香港无名艺术家和街头艺人**生机勃勃**的表演场地。这条标志性的街道从太子延伸到油美地，拥有从杂技到魔术和音乐的各种表演。
&emsp; 但这些天，街头艺人之间的**地盘争夺战**已经爆发。这引发了人们对噪音污染和人群控制的担忧。27岁的街头艺人梁乐喜是音乐团体3jammers的成员，他说：“在这里找到一个位置几乎是不可能的，当你成功了，经常会与其他人争相通过试图成为最大的声响来吸引人群。”
&emsp; 在香港街头表演是合法的，无论有没有许可证，只要噪音不是一种**妨害**或行为不造成**阻碍**。
&emsp; 在一个理想的世界里，旺角的常客刘伟强希望每天都能通过“障碍赛”。他说：“我过去喜欢在西洋菜街南散步，因为那里充满了生动活泼、引人注目的表演，但现在我宁愿绕道而行，因为那里已经变得太拥挤、太吵了。”
&emsp; 由于拥挤，刘先生经常发现自己不得不挤过一群盯着手机的行人，或者躲避推着手推车在人群中飞奔的送货员。他希望看到街道变成一个精心规划的户外剧院，有各种各样的表演。2015年底，香港中文大学心理学系进行了有史以来第一次对香港街头艺人的普查。报告发现，全市估计有300名街头艺人。
&emsp; 根据普查，这些艺术家中超过95%是本地居民。在所有受访的表演者中，90%的专业音乐表演者，1%的专业舞蹈表演者，2%的专业杂技表演者，1%的专业戏剧表演者。
&emsp; “有时我会看到其他人看不起表演者，这让我感到难过。我认为我们应该欣赏他们的勇气和努力，无论是什么形式的艺术。” 刘德华补充说，他认为公众对街头艺术家缺乏开放的态度。
&emsp; 街头艺人梁耀文说：“我看到街头表演者并没有得到真正的欣赏，尤其是在香港。我相信这是因为当地人思想不够开放。”
&emsp; 他回忆起一次不愉快的经历，他在表演中途被保安要求**腾出**一个区域。出于礼貌，他服从了。“即使只有一个人抱怨我们的音量太大，或者我们以任何方式造成了一点干扰，我们就被要求离开。这只是向你展示了这种情况是多么的片面和不公平。”
&emsp; 这位歌手希望公众能够理解和欣赏，大多数街头艺人走上街头是因为他们对音乐和艺术的热爱。
&emsp; “公众需要知道，学习演奏音乐是要付出代价的，只是因为我们决定在街头表演并不会让我们变成乞丐，”梁耀文说。
